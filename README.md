# Top Note
A very simple application similar to sticky notes that is always on top level. 

### Why use it?
If you want to have notes that are always on top of the other windows.

### Why tkinter?
I wanted to make something simple.

### How to use:
You can run it as a project from app.py.

**or**

You can run it either as a standalone exe file (TopNote.exe) or from an exe file in a directory after unzipping it (TopNote.zip). Note that antiviruses will probably act against the standalone version so the directory version is recommended. 

Also note that there is no directory version for previous verions of Top Note.
