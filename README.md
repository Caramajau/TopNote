# Top Note
A very simple application similar to sticky notes that is always on top level. 

### Why use it?
If you want to have notes that are always on top of the other windows.

### Why tkinter?
I wanted to make something simple.

### How to use:
You can run it as a project from app.py.

**or**

You can run it as a standalone exe file (TopNote.exe). Either you can look for the file under release or you can create the executable yourself by using ```pyinstaller TopNote.spec```.

NOTE: antiviruses will probably act against the standalone version.
